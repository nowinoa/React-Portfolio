# Ainhoa Prada Portfolio

## Description
My Portfolio is a web application that showcases my projects and skills. I built this project to create a centralized place where I can display my projects, my skills, and my contact information in a visually appealing and easily accessible format. My motivation for creating this portfolio was to showcase my work to potential employers or clients.

This project solves the problem of having to navigate through multiple websites or repositories to view my projects and skills. With My Portfolio, all of the information is organized in one location, making it easy for others to view and evaluate my work.

Through the development of this project, I learned how to use React, JavaScript, and various npm modules to create a dynamic and responsive web application.
